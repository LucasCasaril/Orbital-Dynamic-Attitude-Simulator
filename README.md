This work reports the study of an orbital simulation used to analyze a cubesat’s passive attitude control system. Such control system aims to guide the satellite’s body without any electrical energy consumption. This simulation is a complete orbital study that takes into account several factors, such as: i) the rotation of the planet; ii) the body’s attitude; iii) the geomagnetic field, etc.

This project is an explanation of the final paper for my Aerospace Engineering Degree. For more information, discussion, and results of the simulation, you can download the entire paper here (https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/197341).

Main Simulink file: "dynamic_simulator.mdl"

Files "Angulo_Phi.m", "Angulo_Rho.m" and "Torque_Aero_Wertz_Fortescue.m" are used for the calculation of the Aerodynamic Torque.
